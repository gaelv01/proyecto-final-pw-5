# My first CRUD
This project relates about a high-school project done started in 2021.
In this project, I made a CRUD system working with server side using PHP and user side using HTML and CSS. The database involved in this project is SQL, using the MySQL DB manager.
The project is based in the 4 operations y databases: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
This project in particular starts my developing career.
